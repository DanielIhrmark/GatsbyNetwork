I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room. Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair. \"We\u0027ve met before,\" muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand. \"I\u0027m sorry about the clock,\" he said. My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn\u0027t muster up\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"It\u0027s stopped raining.\" \"I\u0027m glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I\u0027d like to show her around.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Do you like it?\" \"I love it, but I don\u0027t see how you live there all alone.\" \"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally we came to Gatsby\u0027s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. He hadn\u0027t once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"If it wasn\u0027t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,\" said Gatsby. \"You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Look at this,\" said Gatsby quickly. \"Here\u0027s a lot of clippings--about you.\" They stood side by side examining it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a \"sport shirt\" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue. \"Did we interrupt your exercises?\" inquired Daisy politely. \"I was asleep,\" cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. \"That is, I\u0027d BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . .\" \"Klipspringer plays the piano,\" said Gatsby, cutting him off. \"Don\u0027t you, Ewing, old sport?\" \"I don\u0027t play well. I don\u0027t--I hardly play at all. I\u0027m all out of prac----\" \"We\u0027ll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light. In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy\u0027s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyears! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart. As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn\u0027t be over-dreamed--that voice was a deathless song. They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn\u0027t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn\u0027t. \"I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t be able to,\" I said. \"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby. Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear. \"We won\u0027t be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud. \"I haven\u0027t got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army but I\u0027ve never bought a horse. I\u0027ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.\" The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. \"My God, I believe the man\u0027s coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn\u0027t he know she doesn\u0027t want him?\" \"She says she does want him.\" \"She has a big dinner party and he won\u0027t know a soul there.\" He frowned. \"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\" Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLook around,\" suggested Gatsby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\" \"I\u0027d a little rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I\u0027d rather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion.\" Daisy and Gatsby danced.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"She didn\u0027t like it,\" he said immediately. \"Of course she did.\" \"She didn\u0027t like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn\u0027t have a good time.\" He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression. \"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It\u0027s hard to make her understand.\" \"You mean about the dance?\" \"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\" He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: \"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five years ago. \"And she doesn\u0027t understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to understand. We\u0027d sit for hours----\" He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ewith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy\u0027s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips\u0027 touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027ve got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention. \"Please don\u0027t!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let\u0027s all go home. Why don\u0027t we all go home?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what\u0027s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eknow why we left Chicago? I\u0027m surprised that they didn\u0027t treat you to the story of that little spree.\" Gatsby walked over and stood beside her. \"Daisy, that\u0027s all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn\u0027t matter any more. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it\u0027s all wiped out forever.\" She looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\" \"You never loved him.\" She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late. \"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had \u0027killed a man.\u0027 For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way. It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room. The voice begged again to go. \u0027PLEASE, Tom! I can\u0027t stand this any more.\u0027 Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute. \"Yes.\" He hesitated. \"Was she killed?\" \"Yes.\" \"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It\u0027s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\" He spoke as if Daisy\u0027s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehouse, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt married to her, that was all. When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor. \"I can\u0027t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she\u0027d throw me over, but she didn\u0027t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eway off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn\u0027t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do? On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat\u0027s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.", "to": "Daisy Buchanan", "value": 24}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Jay Gatsby", "title": "Locations: Jay Gatsby\u0027s house\nWeight: 2\nParagraphs: He went out of the room calling \"Ewing!\" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair.

I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not a very good host.\" He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. \"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,\" he urged me. \"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u0027t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned gracefully in my face. \"Please come and see me. . . . Phone book. . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . .\" She was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door. Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby\u0027s guests who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I\u0027d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden. \"Don\u0027t mention it,\" he enjoined me eagerly. \"Don\u0027t give it another thought, old sport.\" The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. \"And don\u0027t forget we\u0027re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o\u0027clock.\" Then the butler, behind his shoulder: \"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.\" \"All right, in a minute. Tell them I\u0027ll be right there. . . . good night.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt nine o\u0027clock, one morning late in July Gatsby\u0027s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach. \u0027Good morning, old sport. You\u0027re having lunch with me today and I thought we\u0027d ride up together.\u0027 He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand. He saw me looking with admiration at his car. \"It\u0027s pretty, isn\u0027t it, old sport.\" He jumped off to give me a better view. \"Haven\u0027t you ever seen it before?\" I\u0027d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town. I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003egradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door. And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn\u0027t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit. \"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly. \"What\u0027s your opinion of me, anyhow?\" A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves. \"Well, I\u0027m going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted. \"I don\u0027t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.\" So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls. \"I\u0027ll tell you God\u0027s truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn\u0027t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.\" He hesitated. \"You\u0027ll hear about it this afternoon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you\u0027re taking Miss Baker to tea.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"No, old sport, I\u0027m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man. \"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.\" A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering. \"Five with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. \"I understand you\u0027re looking for a business gonnegtion.\" The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me: \"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn\u0027t the man!\" \"No?\" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed. \"This is just a friend. I told you we\u0027d talk about that some other time.\" \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"I had a wrong man.\" A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table. \"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I\u0027m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is one of his sentimental days. He\u0027s quite a character around New York--a denizen of Broadway.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"No.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he\u0027s a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: \"He\u0027s the man who fixed the World\u0027s Series back in 1919.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Does it?\u0027 He turned his eyes toward it absently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003einto some of the rooms. Let\u0027s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.\" \"It\u0027s too late.\" \"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven\u0027t made use of it all summer.\" \"I\u0027ve got to go to bed.\" \"All right.\" He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"What day would suit you?\" \"What day would suit YOU?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don\u0027t want to put you to any trouble, you see.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes. \"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately. \"The grass looks fine, if that\u0027s what you mean.\" \"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He looked out the window at it, but judging from his expression I don\u0027t believe he saw a thing. \"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\" I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. \"Will they do?\" I asked. \"Of course, of course! They\u0027re fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old sport.\" The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay\u0027s \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home. \"Why\u0027s that?\" \"Nobody\u0027s coming to tea. It\u0027s too late!\" He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can\u0027t wait all day.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly; it\u0027s just two minutes to four.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe automatic quality of Gatsby\u0027s answer set us all back at least another minute.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn\u0027t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands. \"It\u0027s stopped raining.\" \"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"My house looks well, doesn\u0027t it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole front of it catches the light.\" I agreed that it was splendid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eme just three years to earn the money that bought it.\" \"I thought you inherited your money.\" \"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in the big panic--the panic of the war.\" I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered \"That\u0027s my affair,\" before he realized that it wasn\u0027t the appropriate reply. \"Oh, I\u0027ve been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I\u0027m not in either one now.\" He looked at me with more attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I know what we\u0027ll do,\" said Gatsby, \"we\u0027ll have Klipspringer play the piano.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn\u0027t see\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Three o\u0027Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby\u0027s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion. I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext day Gatsby called me on the phone. \"Going away?\" I inquired. \"No, old sport.\" \"I hear you fired all your servants.\" \"I wanted somebody who wouldn\u0027t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in the afternoons.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough the hall of the Buchanans\u0027 house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebetween two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon. \"What are you doing?\" I inquired. \"Just standing here, old sport.\" Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfshiem\u0027s people,\" behind him in the dark shrubbery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute. \"Yes.\" He hesitated. \"Was she killed?\" \"Yes.\" \"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It\u0027s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\" He spoke as if Daisy\u0027s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive. \"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously. \"Yes, it\u0027s all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You\u0027d better come home and get some sleep.\" He shook his head. \"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\" He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t consider it. He couldn\u0027t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn\u0027t bear to shake him free. It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody--told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass against Tom\u0027s hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy. She was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t think she ever loved him. Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. \u0027You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\u0027 He sat down gloomily. \u0027Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were first married--and loved me more even then, do you see?\u0027 Suddenly he came out with a curious remark: \u0027In any case,\u0027 he said, \u0027it was just personal.\u0027 What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn\u0027t be measured? He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe turned to me apologetically. \"You know, old sport, I\u0027ve never used that pool all summer?\"", "to": "Nick Carraway", "value": 36}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Jay Gatsby", "title": "Locations: Car\nWeight: 1\nParagraphs: \"All right, old sport,\" called Gatsby.

On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby\u0027s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay. \"I\u0027m right across from you.\" \"So you are.\" Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby.

That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I\u0027ve heard it said that Daisy\u0027s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.) At any rate Miss Baker\u0027s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself. \"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehead decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn\u0027t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest\u0027s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could \u0027come over\u0027 some afternoon to a stranger\u0027s garden.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea. \"Don\u0027t bring Tom,\" I warned her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003econfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn\u0027t move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end. I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them. \u0027Left no address?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Say when they\u0027d be back?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Any idea where they are?

But there wasn\u0027t a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn. \u0027Your place looks like the world\u0027s fair,\u0027 I said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I\u0027m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don\u0027t want to put you to any trouble.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How about the day after tomorrow?\" He considered for a moment.

And I thought that if you don\u0027t make very much--You\u0027re selling bonds, aren\u0027t you, old sport?\" \"Trying to.\" \"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn\u0027t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.\" I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyou got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?\" I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. \"Will they do?\" I asked. \"Of course, of course! They\u0027re fine!\" and he added hollowly, \". . .old sport.\" The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay\u0027s \"Economics,\" starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home. \"Why\u0027s that?\" \"Nobody\u0027s coming to tea. It\u0027s too late!\" He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. \"I can\u0027t wait all day.\" \"Don\u0027t be silly; it\u0027s just two minutes to four.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s funny!\" I exclaimed. \"What\u0027s funny?\" She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes. With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to speak to you about something before you go.\" He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: \"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to side, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\" \"You\u0027re just embarrassed, that\u0027s all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy\u0027s embarrassed too.\" \"She\u0027s embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously. \"Just as much as you are.\" \"Don\u0027t talk so loud.\" \"You\u0027re acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only that but you\u0027re rude. Daisy\u0027s sitting in there all alone.\" He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room. I walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. \"Who\u0027s this?\" \"That? That\u0027s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.\" The name sounded faintly familiar. \"He\u0027s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.\" There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently when he was about eighteen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can\u0027t repeat the past.\" \"Can\u0027t repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you can!\" He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. \"I\u0027m going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said, nodding determinedly. \"She\u0027ll see.\" He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was. . . . . . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired. \"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?\" \"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth. \"Was Daisy driving?\" \"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I\u0027ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\" \"It ripped her open----\" \"Don\u0027t tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn\u0027t so I pulled on the emergency\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep. \"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly. \"I waited, and about four o\u0027clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.\" His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn\u0027t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness. \"You ought to go away,\" I said. \"It\u0027s pretty certain they\u0027ll trace your car.\" \"Go away NOW, old sport?\" \"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI looked at my watch and stood up. \"Twelve minutes to my train.\" I didn\u0027t want to go to the city. I wasn\u0027t worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that--I didn\u0027t want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away. \"I\u0027ll call you up,\" I said finally. \"Do, old sport.\" \"I\u0027ll call you about noon.\" We walked slowly down the steps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suppose Daisy\u0027ll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped I\u0027d corroborate this. \"I suppose so.\" \"Well--goodbye.\" We shook hands and I started away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around. \"They\u0027re a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You\u0027re worth the whole damn bunch put together.\" I\u0027ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esmile, as if we\u0027d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye. I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that--I and the others. \u0027Goodbye,\u0027 I called. \u0027I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\u0027 Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Will you ring again?\" \"I\u0027ve rung them three times.\" \"It\u0027s very important.\" \"Sorry. I\u0027m afraid no one\u0027s there.\" I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain. \"Look here, old sport, you\u0027ve got to get somebody for me. You\u0027ve got to try hard. I can\u0027t go through this alone.\" Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he\u0027d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall. Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he\u0027d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man\u0027s voice, very thin and far away. \"This is Slagle speaking. . . .\" \"Yes?\" The name was unfamiliar. \"Hell of a note, isn\u0027t it? Get my wire?\" \"There haven\u0027t been any wires.\" \"Young Parke\u0027s in trouble,\" he said rapidly. \"They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving \u0027em the numbers just five minutes before. What d\u0027you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----\" \"Hello!\" I interrupted breathlessly. \"Look here--this isn\u0027t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby\u0027s dead.\" There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken. I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see now that this has been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.", "to": "Jay Gatsby", "value": 22}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Nick Carraway", "title": "Locations: Jay Gatsby\u0027s house; Car; Nick Carraway\u0027s house\nWeight: 6\nParagraphs: \"Who doesn\u0027t?\" I inquired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her of my surprise.

There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart. As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn\u0027t be over-dreamed--that voice was a deathless song. They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn\u0027t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn\u0027t. \"I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t be able to,\" I said. \"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.

I\u0027ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.\" The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. \"My God, I believe the man\u0027s coming,\" said Tom. \"Doesn\u0027t he know she doesn\u0027t want him?\" \"She says she does want him.\" \"She has a big dinner party and he won\u0027t know a soul there.\" He frowned. \"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.\" Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027ve never met so many celebrities!\" Daisy exclaimed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eour stiff straw hats. \"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life. The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans. \"We can\u0027t move,\" they said together. Jordan\u0027s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine. \"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired. Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone. Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air. \"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that\u0027s Tom\u0027s girl on the telephone.\" We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Very well, then, I won\u0027t sell you the car at all. . . .

Nick. . . .\" \"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy. As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth. \"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"How do you like mother\u0027s friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. \"Do you think they\u0027re pretty?\" \"Where\u0027s Daddy?\" \"She doesn\u0027t look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me. She\u0027s got my hair and shape of the face.\" Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand. \"Come, Pammy.\" \"Goodbye, sweetheart!\" With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse\u0027s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice. Gatsby took up his drink. \"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension. We drank in long greedy swallows. \"I read somewhere that the sun\u0027s getting hotter every year,\" said Tom genially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth\u0027s going to fall into the sun--or wait a minute--it\u0027s just the opposite--the sun\u0027s getting colder every year. \"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I\u0027d like you to have a look at the place.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eeverything\u0027s so confused. Let\u0027s all go to town!\" Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms. \"I\u0027ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to Gatsby, \"but I\u0027m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\" \"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby\u0027s eyes floated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\" Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. \"You always look so cool,\" she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago. \"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently. \"You know the advertisement of the man----\" \"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I\u0027m perfectly willing to go to\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Please don\u0027t.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet. \"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn\u0027t that enough?

Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. \"I\u0027m p-paralyzed with happiness.\" She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003efor a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see.

At any rate Miss Baker\u0027s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour. I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me. \"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically. \"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there\u0027s a persistent wail all night along the North Shore.\" \"How gorgeous! Let\u0027s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added irrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\" \"I\u0027d like to.\" \"She\u0027s asleep. She\u0027s two years old. Haven\u0027t you ever seen her?\" \"Never.\" \"Well, you ought to see her. She\u0027s----\" Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me. \"I\u0027ll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically. \"It\u0027s about the butler\u0027s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler\u0027s nose?\" \"That\u0027s why I came over tonight.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, he wasn\u0027t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose----\" \"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker. \"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position.\" For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom\u0027s ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. \"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. \"We don\u0027t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly. \"Even if we are cousins. You didn\u0027t come to my wedding.\" \"I wasn\u0027t back from the war.\" \"That\u0027s true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I\u0027ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I\u0027m pretty cynical about everything.\" Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn\u0027t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\" \"Very much.\" \"It\u0027ll show you how I\u0027ve gotten to feel about--things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Jordan\u0027s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy, \"over at Westchester.\" \"Oh,--you\u0027re JORdan Baker.\" I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago. \"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won\u0027t you.\" \"If you\u0027ll get up.\" \"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\" \"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I\u0027ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I\u0027ll sort of--oh--fling you together. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----\" \"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven\u0027t heard a word.\" \"She\u0027s a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn\u0027t to let her run around the country this way.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Who oughtn\u0027t to?\" inquired Daisy coldly. \"Her family.\" \"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick\u0027s going to look after her, aren\u0027t you, Nick? She\u0027s going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.\" Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man\u0027s coat. \"You\u0027re a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn\u0027t to drive at all.\" \"I am careful.\" \"No, you\u0027re not.\" \"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly. \"What\u0027s that got to do with it?\" \"They\u0027ll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an accident.\" \"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\" \"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That\u0027s why I like you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Don\u0027t bring Tom,\" I warned her. \"What?\" \"Don\u0027t bring Tom.\" \"Who is \u0027Tom\u0027?\" she asked innocently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard. Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy\u0027s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile. \u0027Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?\u0027 The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car. \u0027Are you in love with me,\u0027 she said low in my ear. \u0027Or why did I have to come alone?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"We haven\u0027t met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. \"Five years next November.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisy\u0027s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat. \"These things excite me SO,\" she whispered. \"If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I\u0027ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I\u0027m giving out green----\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe looked around after a moment and told me the girl was \"common but pretty,\" and I knew that except for the half hour she\u0027d been alone with Gatsby she wasn\u0027t having a good time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wouldn\u0027t let you operate on me!\" It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek. \"I like her,\" said Daisy, \"I think she\u0027s lovely.\" But the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn\u0027t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented \"place\" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut they didn\u0027t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel. The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy\u0027s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \u0027a place to have a mint julep.\u0027 Each of us said over and over that it was a \u0027crazy idea\u0027--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .

I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.\" \"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. \"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What\u0027ll we plan?\" She turned to me helplessly. \"What do people plan?\" Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger. \"Look!\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\" We all looked--the knuckle was black and blue. \"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn\u0027t mean to\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut you DID do it.

When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air. \"Lots of people come who haven\u0027t been invited,\" she said suddenly. \"That girl hadn\u0027t been invited. They simply force their way in and he\u0027s too polite to object.\" \"I\u0027d like to know who he is and what he does,\" insisted Tom. \"And I think I\u0027ll make a point of finding out.\" \"I can tell you right now,\" she answered. \"He owned some drug stores, a lot of drug stores.

Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm. \"You take Nick and Jordan.

Then I turned back to Gatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had \u0027killed a man.\u0027 For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way. It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.

I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible.

One October day in nineteen-seventeen---- (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) --I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way. The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay\u0027s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, \"anyways, for an hour!\" When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn\u0027t see me until I was five feet away. \"Hello Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\" I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn\u0027t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn\u0027t lay eyes on him again for over four\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Very well, then, I won\u0027t sell you the car at all. . . .

Nick. . . .\" \"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.

One October day in nineteen-seventeen---- (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) --I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way. The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay\u0027s house.

She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody there.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You must know Gatsby.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, he wasn\u0027t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose----\" \"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker. \"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position.\" For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom\u0027s ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing. \"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethat I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone. I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden. Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by. \"Hello!\" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden. \"I thought you might be here,\" she responded absently as I came up. \"I remembered you lived next door to----\" She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she\u0027d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps. \"Hello!\" they cried together. \"Sorry you didn\u0027t win.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethat sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety. \"Let\u0027s get out,\" whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. \"This is much too polite for me.\" We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way. The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there. She couldn\u0027t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn\u0027t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehad taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound. At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. \"Your face is familiar,\" he said, politely. \"Weren\u0027t you in the Third Division during the war?\" \"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.\" \"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I\u0027d seen you somewhere before.\" We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning. \"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.\" \"What time?\" \"Any time that suits you best.\" It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled. \"Having a gay time now?\" she inquired. \"Much better.\" I turned again to my new acquaintance. \"This is an unusual\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"He\u0027s just a man named Gatsby.\" \"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?\" \"Now YOU\u0027re started on the subject,\" she answered with a wan smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said \u0027What Gatsby?\u0027 and when I described him--I was half asleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe wants to know-- continued Jordan --if you\u0027ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"He\u0027s afraid. He\u0027s waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see he\u0027s a regular tough underneath it all.\" Something worried me. \"Why didn\u0027t he ask you to arrange a meeting?\" \"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is right next door.\" \"Oh!\" \"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he\u0027d go mad: \" \u0027I don\u0027t want to do anything out of the way!\u0027 he kept saying. \u0027I want to see her right next door.\u0027 \"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom\u0027s he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn\u0027t know very much about Tom, though he says he\u0027s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eof Daisy\u0027s name.\" It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan\u0027s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn\u0027t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.\" \"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to me. \"Does she want to see Gatsby?\" \"She\u0027s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn\u0027t want her to know. You\u0027re just supposed to invite her to tea.\" We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eour stiff straw hats. \"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life. The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans. \"We can\u0027t move,\" they said together. Jordan\u0027s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine. \"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired. Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone. Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air. \"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that\u0027s Tom\u0027s girl on the telephone.\" We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup\u00e9. \"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat\u0027s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\" \"No thanks. But I\u0027d be glad if you\u0027d order me the taxi. I\u0027ll wait outside.\" Jordan put her hand on my arm. \"Won\u0027t you come in, Nick?\" \"No thanks.\" I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more. \"It\u0027s only half past nine,\" she said. I\u0027d be damned if I\u0027d go in; I\u0027d had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler\u0027s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate. I hadn\u0027t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esmile, as if we\u0027d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye. I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that--I and the others. \u0027Goodbye,\u0027 I called. \u0027I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\u0027 Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUsually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry. \"I\u0027ve left Daisy\u0027s house,\" she said. \"I\u0027m at Hempstead and I\u0027m going down to Southampton this afternoon.\" Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy\u0027s house, but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid. \"You weren\u0027t so nice to me last night.\" \"How could it have mattered then?\" Silence for a moment. Then-- \"However--I want to see you.\" \"I want to see you too.\" \"Suppose I don\u0027t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?\" \"No--I don\u0027t think this afternoon.\" \"Very well.\" \"It\u0027s impossible this afternoon. Various----\" We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren\u0027t talking any longer. I don\u0027t know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didn\u0027t care. I couldn\u0027t have talked to her across a tea-table that day if\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw me over on the telephone. I don\u0027t give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\" We shook hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, and do you remember--\" she added, \"----a conversation we had once about driving a car?\" \"Why--not exactly.\" \"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn\u0027t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.

Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the \u0027Saturday Evening Post\u0027--the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms. When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. \u0027To be continued,\u0027 she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \u0027in our very next issue.\u0027 Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up. \u0027Ten o\u0027clock,\u0027 she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. \u0027Time for this good girl to go to bed.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby\u0027s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind. \"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom. \"See what?\" He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along. \"You think I\u0027m pretty dumb, don\u0027t you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but I have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don\u0027t believe that, but science----\" He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss. \"I\u0027ve made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could have gone deeper if I\u0027d known----\" \"Do you mean you\u0027ve been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously. \"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\" \"About Gatsby.\" \"About Gatsby!

I suppose you\u0027ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends--in the modern world.\" Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth.

To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Jordan\u0027s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy, \"over at Westchester.\" \"Oh,--you\u0027re JORdan Baker.\" I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago. \"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won\u0027t you.\" \"If you\u0027ll get up.\" \"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\" \"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I\u0027ll arrange a marriage.

The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do. I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg\u0027s persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON.

Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away. \"Now, if you\u0027ll let me have that name again correct----\" Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back. \"If somebody\u0027ll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table.

In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face. \u0027The God Damn coward!\u0027 he whimpered. \u0027He didn\u0027t even stop his car.\u0027 The Buchanans\u0027 house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines. \u0027Daisy\u0027s home,\u0027 he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly. \u0027I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There\u0027s nothing we can do tonight.\u0027 A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases. \u0027I\u0027ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you\u0027re waiting\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store.

His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table. \"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I\u0027m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.\"", "to": "Jay Gatsby", "value": 1}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Meyer Wolfsheim", "title": "Locations: Restaurant; New York\nWeight: 4\nParagraphs: --so I took one look at him--\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, \"--and what do you think I did?\" \"What?\" I inquired politely.
